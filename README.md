The project involves analyzing multiple datasets from an e-commerce platform to derive insights related to customer behavior, order patterns, product performance, and overall business metrics. The primary datasets include:

Customers: Information about the customers.
Orders: Details of the orders placed.
Order Items: Information on individual items in each order.
Order Payments: Payment details for each order.
Order Reviews: Customer reviews and ratings of orders.
Products: Information about the products available on the platform.
Sellers: Information about the sellers on the platform.
Geo Locations: Geographic information related to customer and seller locations.
Key Analytical Steps:
Data Import and Cleaning: Loading the data into data frames and checking for missing values and appropriate data types.
Data Transformation: Converting date columns to datetime objects for easier manipulation and analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution and relationships between different variables through summary statistics and visualizations.
Customer Segmentation: Segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior and recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) analysis.
Sales Analysis: Analyzing order trends, sales performance over time, and identifying peak sales periods.
Product Performance: Evaluating which products are performing well and understanding customer preferences.
Review Analysis: Assessing customer satisfaction through review ratings and sentiment analysis.
Geographical Analysis: Understanding the geographical distribution of customers and sellers.
Potential Questions and Answers:
Question: What is the distribution of customer purchase behavior?
Answer: The distribution can be analyzed using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, which segments customers into different groups based on their purchasing history.

Question: How do sales vary over different periods?
Answer: Sales trends can be visualized using time-series analysis, identifying peak sales periods and seasonal trends.

Question: Which products are the bestsellers?
Answer: By analyzing the order items data, we can identify the products with the highest sales volume and revenue.

Question: What is the average customer rating for products?
Answer: The order reviews dataset provides information on customer ratings, allowing us to calculate the average rating for each product.

Question: How does customer satisfaction vary by product category?
Answer: By grouping review ratings by product categories, we can determine which categories have higher or lower customer satisfaction.

Question: Are there any significant geographical trends in customer purchases?
Answer: Geo-location data can be used to map out customer purchase trends, identifying regions with higher sales volumes.

Question: What is the correlation between order value and delivery time?
Answer: By analyzing the relationship between order values and delivery times, we can understand if higher value orders are delivered faster or slower compared to lower value orders.

Question: How effective are different payment methods?
Answer: The order payments data can be analyzed to determine the distribution of payment methods and their correlation with order completion and customer satisfaction
